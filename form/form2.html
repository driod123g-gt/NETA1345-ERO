                    This event was created with the intention of celebrating a dear friend's birthday.
                    A lot of the games that we are going to play will be explained in the FAQ section of
                    this website. Food and drinks will absolutely be provided. Some snacks will be also be
                    provided but if you want to contribute a snack, that would be lovely. Attendees are encouraged
                    to dress up as a monkey and even wear a monkey mask. Participating in the dodgeball games is not
                    mandatory; Even though the atmosphere will be thick with competitive spirit, we encourage
                    you to chill and have a good time whether you are playing or not. This is not a strictly
                    organized event. Once all attendees playing have run out of steam, something else will
                    be figured out.</font>

    <summary>Why did we have to choose foods?</summary>
    <p>The simple answer is because we want to know an estimate
